# Performance Testing Checklist

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Optimizations

### 1. **Run Another Lighthouse Audit**
```bash
# Open Chrome DevTools
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
# Go to Lighthouse tab
# Run Performance audit
# Compare with previous results
```

### 2. **Check Core Web Vitals in Browser**
- Open Browser Console while on the site
- Look for performance logs:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
  - FID (First Input Delay) 
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
  - Long task warnings

### 3. **Test Motion Preferences**
```bash
# In Chrome DevTools:
# 1. Open Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
# 2. Type "Render"
# 3. Select "Show Rendering"
# 4. Check "Emulate CSS prefers-reduced-motion"
# 5. Refresh page - animations should be disabled
```

### 4. **Bundle Analysis**
```bash
cd portfolio
npm run build
# Check the Route sizes in the output
# Main page should be ~212 kB First Load JS
```

### 5. **Visual Performance Testing**
- **Lazy Loading**: Scroll down slowly - Projects and Experience sections should load on demand
- **Animations**: Should be smooth and GPU-accelerated (no janky movements)
- **Font Loading**: No FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text) or layout shift

### 6. **Network Throttling Test**
```bash
# In Chrome DevTools:
# 1. Go to Network tab
# 2. Set throttling to "Slow 3G"
# 3. Refresh page
# 4. Observe loading performance
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | Expected | Target |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| Performance Score | 88 | 95+ | 90+ |
| LCP | 3.2s | 2.0-2.5s | <2.5s |
| FCP | 1.7s | 1.2-1.5s | <1.8s |
| Speed Index | 5.1s | 3.0-4.0s | <3.4s |
| TBT | 80ms | 30-50ms | <200ms |

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features to Verify

### âœ… Animation Optimizations
- [ ] Fewer particles visible (15 instead of 50)
- [ ] Smoother animations with no janky movements  
- [ ] GPU acceleration working (check in DevTools Performance tab)
- [ ] Respect for reduced motion preferences

### âœ… Lazy Loading
- [ ] Projects section loads when scrolling down
- [ ] Experience section loads when scrolling down
- [ ] Loading skeletons appear briefly
- [ ] No layout shift during component loading

### âœ… Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Initial JS bundle ~212 kB
- [ ] Separate chunks for lazy-loaded components
- [ ] CSS optimization in production build

### âœ… Security Headers
- [ ] Check headers in Network tab
- [ ] CSP header present
- [ ] HSTS with preload
- [ ] Proper referrer policy

## ðŸ”§ Debugging Performance Issues

### If LCP is still high:
1. Check if images are optimized
2. Verify font loading strategy
3. Look for render-blocking resources

### If animations are still janky:
1. Check GPU acceleration in DevTools
2. Verify will-change properties
3. Look for layout thrashing

### If bundle is too large:
1. Analyze with bundle analyzer
2. Check for duplicate dependencies
3. Verify lazy loading is working

## ðŸ“ˆ Production Deployment

After testing locally:

1. **Deploy to production**
2. **Run Lighthouse on production URL**
3. **Monitor Core Web Vitals in production**
4. **Set up analytics tracking for performance**
